# Introduction

As of 2023, more than 60% of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck according to CNBC and Forbes. Factors such as inflation, lack of savings, and debt leaves them vulnerable to emergency expenses. Hence, personal financing and budgeting is ever more important to keep up with the rising costs of living.

Personal Finance is a web app to help individuals keep track of their expenditures and help estimate their budget. However, actual expenses may vary, especially since the calculations are only up-to-date for 2023.
